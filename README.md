Datacamp Python Project: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
**Python projects on DataCamp**

*Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Description
In these projects, I'll apply what I've learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to a real-world data science problem. I'll use everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib to see if Netflix movies are growing shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office."

This project allows me to get expertise with exploratory data analysis, which allows me to execute key activities like editing raw data and generating inferences from the plots I make.

## üì∫ Projects

*Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.*

#### Project tasks
1. Loading CSV file containing Netflix data information into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame fromenter code here a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?
